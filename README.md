# DRAM-Vulnerability-Analysis
 – Employed HammerTime to simulate RowHammer attacks on DRAM cells, incorporating various attack
methods from existing studies.
– Collected comprehensive data on DRAM cell behavior of modern hardware during simulated attacks to
understand vulnerability patterns.
– Aim to develop a predictive NAR neural network model trained on the collected data to forecast bit
flips and assess potential manipulability of the RowHammer process.
